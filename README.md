# Project 10 - Full Stack App with React and a REST API

This is a Full Stack JavaScript app using NodeJS + ReactJS. The app allows users to view, update, and delete courses. **Aiming for exceeds expectations: all bonus requirements completed.** 


## Programming Approach

This project uses SQLite and Sequelize for managing interactions with the database on the backend. *Async/Await* patterns are used for data fetching in routes and middleware is used to handle errors. 

The front end is built with React and *Async/Await* patters are used for data fetching. *Context* is used for managing data througout the app. The app allows the user to Sign up/Sign in and create, read, update, and delete courses in the database. *Hooks* and functional components are used instead of *Classes*. **Bonus:** *NotFound, Forbidden, and Error* routes are shown depending on the situation. **Bonus:** Users credentials are persisted using cookies. **Bonus:** Users are redirected to the routes they were trying to access once they sign in.

## Syntax and Conventions

The app is written in ES6 JavaScript.
